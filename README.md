# Preprocessing Data
During the data preprocessing step, I identified three tasks that I believe are crucial and require careful attention: data transformation, handling outliers, and managing missing values. This repository serves as a resource to share what I've learned and example R files on these topics for anyone interested and as a reference for myself in case I need it in the future.
